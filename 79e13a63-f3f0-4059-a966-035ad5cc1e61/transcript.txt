an area of the matter the channel i hope you guys are doing extremely well today's video is going to be extremely important because i'm going to talk about the current generation's obsession with solving five hundred or more lead core problems wherever i see the like assault five hundred have sold eight hundred thousand barrels what we are going to talk about in this video so i'm not sure if you know me or not so during my time added internet amazon after that i joined media dot net as a software engineer and four guys who know me dot net are the interviews that media dot net after that i went on to give interviews of facebook and google and kulgam working at google like this entirely in and out so i know how much is required been seeing this pattern lately that people are just running behind those numbers and that is what i will be talking about in this video understand numbers give you a dopamine but you need to use your brain wisely because time is critical like you cannot just waste your time just to increase those to decorate your profile because at the end of the day what matters is your skill sets so what we will be talking about in this video as the things that you need to do other things that you do not need to do when you're using lead called for interview prep do not solve problems that you know you can add is very very important what seen is people know the solution of a problem this stereotype the code just click on the submit because they want to see that accepted thing dude what are you doing not upskilling yourself you're just satisfying your ego that yes it's always actually didn't you already have solved that problem that is why you're able to solve the problem in one go you only solve problems for which you don't know the solution you only solved problem for which you did don't know if this solution will work or not any problem that you know that you have solved this problem or i know that the solution is definitely going to have avoided move ahead that is what you need to do before my amazon internship interview the number of problems i did was overall two fifty only it could make sure those problems so it's important that you solve quality problems that you cannot solve on the first call that you've like you are not sure of the optimal solution only those problems are the ones that you should solve and please do not solve for the sake of the numbers the competition rising up solving problems alone is not going to help you you will need to build projects need to get mock interviews resume has to be polished enough and you'll be requiring reference when the time is their total recommended check out replaced because they have some amazing mentors why am i talking about maintains because everyone yes everyone has a personalised query where struggling from something or something else and they need a personalized roadmap and this is where the main test comment they will be sitting with you they'll be hearing all your doubts and after that we'll be preparing you a personalised roadmap oh that roadmap and every week they'll be checking up on you okay did you do it hey did you do it and when someone is watching trust me you tend to perform a lot better once you're prepared once you have done your projects after that they'll be helping you with mock interview so that before the interview you get a vibe of how the interviews after that they will be polishing your rescue once you're done with that they'll also be helping you with reference because most of the engineers have a good circle as well so what are you waiting for book your free trial session with the mental of your choice right now at replaced thousand in order to get extra housing projects to try learning topics packed and vice versa people want to learn a topic that is great what they do is they go well it could any other platform and the sorted by easy medium hard start solving all the easy ones then the go-to medium then they go too hard they end up solving hundred hundred fifty problems and most of them are repeating patterns not required is not necessary what you need to do is to identify patterns for an example a topic like binary search it has probably ten or twelve what you need to do is ready to cover these ten or twelve patterns for every pattern if need to problems whatever number of problems you need to understand that pattern that it might happen for a pattern in binary search for a pattern in my research you might need one to understand it and depth the moment you understand that pattern that move ahead just do not solve like keep solving problems just because you enjoy that pattern it's important to finish up wrap up the topics quickly like i made this binary search playlist what made it and do you understand it and you can solve any of the progress so please do not solve problems by just giving topic names it is good when you are revising but we're learning it's important to be quick because you need to do a lot of other things as well point number three participate in contest why am i saying a common trend whoever is solving five hundred eight hundred thousand and fourteen hundred whatever is the number most of them are not participating in contests and at the end of the day whenever they go into the coding now struggling to understand one thing that in the difficulty level is slightly tougher because the competition is so you have to be at your best you cannot say that i'll get the interview until clear written order to get that interview collect thousands of people appearing for an opening so you have to be prepared for that coding out and nowadays the coding nouns are getting tougher and tougher that is why participating in contest is very critical water coding rooms it's a closed payment with unknown questions with a timer how can you replicate that how can you practice that environments the best ways to participate in contests just opening a lead core problem and solving is not under that pressure women try not under the pressure of that time timer ticking up you got you need to practice that is why please please participate in contest and after the contest is finished pleas of solve the problems that even not able to because this is how you'll understand if you are able to apply those concepts or not and whichever concepts are still weak try to solve more and more problems on that instead of solving random problems and like increasing your number count got a phone number four to diversify topics as much as you can why am i saying that i've seen a lot of profiles that sold like five hundred eight hundred lead to problems and when i go over the profile i see that the topic specifically the advanced topics like p the trees try haven't solved a lot of problems on its side a notion that people are solving a lot of problems but they're solving something like a binary search list the upper like the easy medium section a lot but when it comes to the harder like advanced concepts that kind of backing up so it's critical that when you're picking up a topic don't get into this notion that i'm going to learn it entirely binary research because you can never learn a topic entirely you can never learn anything entirely on this planet you're picking up assume your playlist it's fine it's time to move on you'll be tested when you're giving contest the moment you give contest you'll find the problem on by research if you cannot absolve and that is how you learn you just cannot stick to binary search for six months we gotta move to advance topics to try to diversify topics as much as you can try touching all the topics because that is important having a well diversified number on all the topics is like that is what will matter when you go to interviews only you can be on any topic and for that it should be knowing that topic in order to at least give it a try that is why try diversifying topics do not look at numbers just keep solving at the end of one year you will see that the numbers are good look at your profile they will be great solving it for the purpose of the numbers it won't help your quality problems pattern by and on all the topics you should definitely check out seven years ago the link in the description you get video solutions as well you get the articles as well you get the c plus plus job of javascript code as well and that is all you will be requiring for your interview prep along with getting your project's done as important as well so do not miss out on that aspect and a possible to get a mentor who will be leaving your resume will be taking your mock interviews pushing you every now and then checkout replaced for some amazing mentors the link between the reception video and and some other videos oh oh oh
