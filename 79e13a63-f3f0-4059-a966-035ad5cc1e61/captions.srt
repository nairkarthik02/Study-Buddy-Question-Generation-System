1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
an area of the matter the channel i hope you guys are doing extremely

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,330
well today's video is going to be extremely important because i'm going to talk

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,070
about the current generation's obsession with solving five hundred or more lead core problems

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,030
wherever i see the like assault five hundred have sold eight hundred thousand barrels

5
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,910
what we are going to talk about in this video so i'm not sure

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,160
if you know me or not so during my time added

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,239
internet amazon after that i joined media dot net as a software engineer and

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,130
four guys who know me dot net

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,995
are the interviews that media dot net after that i went on to give

10
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,850
interviews of facebook and google and kulgam working at google

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,858
like this

12
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:39,540
entirely in and out so i know how much is required been seeing this

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,890
pattern lately that people are just running behind those numbers and that is what

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
i will be talking about in this video understand numbers give you a dopamine

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,890
but you need to use your brain wisely because time is critical like you

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,500
cannot just waste your time just to increase those

17
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:59,790
to decorate your profile because at the end of the day what matters is

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,450
your skill sets so what we will be talking about in this video as

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,660
the things that you need to do other things that you do not need

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,480
to do when you're using lead called for interview prep

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,120
do not solve problems that you know you can add is very very important

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,960
what seen is people know the solution of a problem this stereotype the code

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,980
just click on the submit because they want to see that accepted thing dude

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,460
what are you doing not upskilling yourself you're just satisfying your ego that yes

25
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:31,830
it's always actually didn't you already have solved that problem that is why you're

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,940
able to solve the problem in one go you only solve problems for which

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,120
you don't know the solution you only solved problem for which you did

28
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,600
don't know if this solution will work or not any problem that you know

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,020
that you have solved this problem or i know that the solution is definitely

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,769
going to have avoided move ahead that is what you need to do before

31
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,570
my amazon internship interview the number of problems i did was overall two fifty

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,731
only it could make sure those

33
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,789
problems so it's important that you solve quality problems that you cannot solve on

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,720
the first call that you've like you are not sure of the optimal solution

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,716
only those problems are the ones that you should solve and please do not

36
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:14,430
solve for the sake of the numbers the competition rising up solving problems alone

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,400
is not going to help you you will need to build projects

38
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,780
need to get mock interviews resume has to be polished enough and you'll be

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,227
requiring reference when the time is their total recommended

40
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:29,430
check out replaced because they have some amazing mentors why am i talking about

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,560
maintains because everyone yes everyone has a personalised query where struggling from something or

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,280
something else and they need a personalized roadmap and this is where the main

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,700

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,045
oh that roadmap and every week they'll be checking up on you okay did

00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,530
you do it hey did you do it and when someone is watching trust

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,860
me you tend to perform a lot better once you're prepared once you have

48
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,120
done your projects after that they'll be helping you with mock interview so that

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,590
before the interview you get a vibe of how the interviews after that they

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,760
will be polishing your rescue

51
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,900
once you're done with that they'll also be helping you with reference because most

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,380
of the engineers have a good circle as well so what are you waiting

53
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,130
for book your free trial session with the mental of your choice right now

54
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,060
at replaced

55
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,810
thousand in order to get extra housing projects

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
to try learning topics packed and vice versa

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,699
people want to learn a topic that is great what they do is they

58
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:30,480
go well it could

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,620
any other platform

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,440
and the sorted by easy medium hard start solving all the easy ones then

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,549
the go-to medium then they go too hard they end up solving hundred hundred

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,960
fifty problems and most of them are repeating patterns not required is not necessary

63
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,980
what you need to do is to identify patterns for an example a topic

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,680
like binary search it has probably ten or twelve

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,130
what you need to do is ready to cover these ten or twelve patterns

66
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,410
for every pattern if need to problems

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,530
whatever number of problems you need to understand that pattern that it might happen

68
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,490
for a pattern in binary search for a pattern in my research you might

69
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,644
need one to understand it and depth the moment you understand that pattern that

70
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,280
move ahead just do not solve like keep solving problems just because you enjoy

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,470
that pattern it's important to finish up

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,418
wrap up the topics quickly like i made this binary search playlist what made

73
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:25,003
it and

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,970
do you understand it and you can solve any of the progress so please

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,020
do not solve problems by just giving topic names it is good when you

76
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,100
are revising but we're learning it's important to be quick because you need to

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,410
do a lot of other things as well point number three

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,510
participate in contest why am i saying a common trend whoever is solving five

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,170
hundred eight hundred thousand and fourteen hundred whatever is the number most of them

80
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,289
are not participating in contests and at the end of the day whenever they

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,630
go into the coding now struggling to understand one thing that in the difficulty

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,510
level is slightly tougher because the competition is

83
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,799
so you have to be at your best you cannot say that i'll get

84
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:08,760
the interview until clear written order to get that interview collect thousands of people

85
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,480
appearing for an opening so you have to be prepared for that coding out

86
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:17,130
and nowadays the coding nouns are getting tougher and tougher that is why participating

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,670
in contest is very critical water coding rooms it's a closed

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,630
payment with unknown questions with a timer how can you replicate that how can

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,190
you practice that environments the best ways to participate in contests just opening a

90
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,300
lead core problem and solving is not under that pressure women try not under

91
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,280
the pressure of that time timer ticking up you got you need to practice

92
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,040
that is why please please participate

93
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,590
in contest and after the contest is finished pleas of solve the problems that

94
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,860
even not able to because this is how you'll understand if you are able

95
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,059
to apply those concepts or not and whichever concepts are still weak try to

96
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,960
solve more and more problems on that instead of solving random problems and like

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,660
increasing your number count got a phone number four

98
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:05,069
to diversify topics as much as you can why am i saying that i've

99
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,040
seen a lot of profiles that sold like five hundred eight hundred lead to

100
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,910
problems and when i go over the profile i see that the topic specifically

101
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,160
the advanced topics like p

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,690
the trees try haven't solved a lot of problems on its side a notion

103
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,960
that people are solving a lot of problems but they're solving something like a

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,700
binary search list the upper like the easy medium section a lot but when

105
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,330
it comes to the harder like advanced concepts that kind of backing up so

106
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,200
it's critical that when you're picking up a topic don't get into this notion

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,320
that

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,786
i'm going to learn it entirely

109
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,800
binary research because you can never learn a topic entirely

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,284
you can never learn anything entirely on this planet you're picking up

111
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,760
assume your playlist it's fine it's time to move on you'll be tested when

112
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,910
you're giving contest the moment you give contest you'll find the problem on by

113
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:58,500
research if you cannot absolve and that is how you learn you just cannot

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,340
stick to binary search for six months we gotta move to advance topics to

115
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,730
try to diversify topics as much as you can try touching

116
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,580
all the topics because that is important having a well diversified number on all

117
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,210
the topics is like that is what will matter when you go to interviews

118
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,760
only you can be on any topic and for that it should be knowing

119
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,698
that topic in order to at least give it a try that is why

120
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,080
try diversifying topics do not look at numbers just keep solving at the end

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
of one year you will see that the numbers are good look at your

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,739
profile they will be great solving it for the purpose of the numbers it

123
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,335
won't help your

124
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,290
quality problems pattern by and on all the topics you should definitely check out

125
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,520
seven years ago

126
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:45,360
the link in the description you get video solutions as well you get the

127
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,260
articles as well you get the c plus plus job of javascript code as

128
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,920
well and that is all you will be requiring for your interview prep along

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,400
with getting your project's done as important as well so do not miss out

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,580
on that aspect and a possible to get a mentor who will be leaving

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,423
your resume will be taking your mock interviews

132
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:05,760
pushing you every now and then checkout replaced for some amazing mentors the link

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,660
between the reception

134
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,855
video and and some other videos

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,740
oh

136
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:19,740
